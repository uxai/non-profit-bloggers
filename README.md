# üíú Non-profit bloggers
It's hard nowadays to find people who write for the joy of writing. I hope to compile a list of blogs from people who find joy in writing.

If you would like to share your passion of writing without the need of monetary motivation - I've created a badge below you may display on your blog and link to this page.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uxai/non-profit-bloggers/main/nonprofit-blogger-badge.svg) ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uxai/non-profit-bloggers/main/nonprofit-blogger-badge-green.svg) ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uxai/non-profit-bloggers/main/nonprofit-blogger-badge-red.svg)

Replace the image URL represented as `{badge link here}` with the proper URL from your own server:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/uxai/non-profit-bloggers/" target="_blank">
  <img src="{badge link here}" alt="Non-profit bloggers badge">
</a>
```
### ‚úÖ Criteria
To be added to this list, your blog should meet the following criteria: 
* No ads
* Selling services/merchandise shouldn't be the primary goal
* Sponsored posts should be at a bare minimum
* Your blog should not be written by AI in any way shape or form

### üì¨ Submit your website
Create a Pull request or create a new issue with the following information:
If you want to invite someone who doesn't have github - file a [ticket here](https://todo.sr.ht/~cendol/non-profit-bloggers)
1. Category
2. Title of the blog
3. URL
4. RSS Feed URL
4. (Optional) Emoji that represents your blog, this will be displayed before the name of your blog.
5. Let me know the Author name to feature and if you would like to link your github.

### üôÖ Removal of websites from the list
Every once in a while I may go through the list to see which blogs are still active.

If you find a blog in the list has gone in the way of ads or extensive tracking or has simply shutdown, please flag it so it may be removed.

Happy blogging and reading!

## Discord

I have started a discord server for those who are/want to be on the list and would like to collaborate with other writers and bloggers such as yourself.
