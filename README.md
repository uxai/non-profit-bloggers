# Non Profit bloggers
It's hard nowadays to find people who write for the joy of writing. I hope to compile a list of blogs from people who find joy in writing.

To be added to this list, your blog should meet the following criteria: 
1. No ads
2. Selling services/merchandise shouldn't be the primary goal
3. Sponsored posts should be at a bare minimum
4. Your blog shouldn't be written by AI

We will prioritize blogs on the list by those who also do not require cookies, and have minimal data tracking. 

### Submit your website
Create a Pull reuqest or create a new issue with the following information:
1. Category
2. Title of the blog
3. URL
4. (Optional) Emoji that represents your blog, this will be displayed before the name of your blog.
5. Let me know the Author name to feature and if you would like to link your github.

### Removal of websites from the list
Every once in a while I may go through the list to see which blogs are still active.

If you find a blog in the list has gone in the way of ads or extensive tracking or has simply shutdown, please flag it so it may be removed.

Happy blogging and reading!
